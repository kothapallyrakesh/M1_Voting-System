# Introduction
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. It is usually played on paper but as the technology evolved, here is a digital version of it.
This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement and understand multiple C programming concepts.

# Tic-tac-toe Game Features and Benefits
It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m×n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game.Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as a nd game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2.It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points.

# Explanation:
The game starts giving you three input options(1, 2, 3):
1 means you play using 'X'.
2 means you play using 'O'.
3 means you exit the game.
The game ends when:
It is in a draw situation , i.e, a total of 9 moves have been completed and novody has won.
You win.
The computer wins.
The game continues in the beginning if the check for draw is false.
Then it checks if anyone has won yet.
If not, then it again checks if it is a draw situation.
